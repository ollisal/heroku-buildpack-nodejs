Heroku Buildpack for Node.js
============================

This is a fork of the official [Heroku buildpack](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) for Node.js apps.

The `ui-bower-grunt` branch serves a SPA UI from ui/ using grunt with dependencies managed via bower.

The `be-gulp` branch runs a backend service process using gulp.

See the official buildpack's documentation for more details.
